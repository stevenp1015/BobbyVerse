# Bobby-Vision Intelligent Business Management System - Development Roadmap

This document outlines the planned development roadmap for the Bobby-Vision system, following a logical order of implementation.

## Development Roadmap - Logical Order

1.  **Refine Predictive Pricing - Historical Data Relevance:** Enhance the selection of historical job data for the predictive pricing engine by:
    *   Implementing more sophisticated text similarity scoring or weighting.
    *   Incorporating job scope/size into relevance calculation (requires storing and using this data).
    *   Implementing clustering or categorization of historical jobs.
    *   Adding a feedback loop for Bobby's input on prediction accuracy.
2.  **Implement Contextual/Dynamic Service Descriptions:** Integrate Gemini to generate tailored service descriptions for documents.
3.  **Integrate External APIs:** Connect to external services for property data (e.g., Google Maps, Zillow) and supplier information (e.g., Home Depot, Lowe's, ABC Supply).
4.  **Implement AI-Powered Photo & Document Analysis:** Integrate a vision model (like `gemini-2.5-flash`) for photo analysis to suggest repair items.
5.  **Implement Automated Email Drafting and Sending:** Automate the creation and sending of emails with attached documents.
6.  **Implement Comprehensive Error Handling:** Add robust error handling across the backend.
7.  **Implement Authentication and Authorization:** Secure the system with user authentication and authorization.
8.  **Write Tests:** Develop unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
9.  **Set Up Deployment:** Configure deployment infrastructure and pipelines.
10. **Frontend Development:** Build the user interface to interact with the backend.
