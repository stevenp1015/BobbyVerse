# JULES'S DAMAGE REPORT

## üìå Rules & Guidelines
This living document details the root causes of the test failures and the plan to fix them.

### 1. Document Structure
- Each test failure gets its own section with clear headers
- Follow the standardized failure template for consistency
- Include timestamps for all entries
- Use emojis for quick visual scanning (‚úÖ Passed, ‚ùå Failed, ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning, üîç Investigation)

### 2. Required Information for Each Issue
- **Test Name**: File and test case name
- **Error Message**: Exact error output
- **Environment**: OS, Node version, dependencies
- **Repro Steps**: How to trigger the failure
- **Hypothesis**: Initial analysis of potential causes
- **Status**: Open/In Progress/Resolved
- **Resolution**: How it was fixed (when applicable)

### 3. Version Control
- Link to specific commits or PRs when available
- Note any branch being tested
- Include dependency versions if relevant

### 4. Severity Levels
- üî¥ Critical: Blocks all testing
- üü† High: Major functionality broken
- üü° Medium: Partial functionality affected
- üîµ Low: Minor issues, edge cases

### 5. Investigation Process
1. Document initial observations
2. Formulate testable hypotheses
3. Note any patterns across failures
4. Document dead ends and findings
5. Record final resolution

### Test Failure: `pricingService.test.js`

*   **Test Name:** `pricingService.test.js`
*   **Error Message:** `Cannot find module '@google/genai' from '__tests__/services/pricingService.test.js'`
*   **Hypothesis:** The `@google/genai` module is not installed. This is a simple dependency issue.

---

### Test Failure: `intelligence.test.js`

*   **Test Name:** `intelligence.test.js`
*   **Error Message:** `Cannot find module '@google/generative-ai' from 'services/nlpService.js'`
*   **Hypothesis:** The `@google/generative-ai` module is not installed. This is another simple dependency issue.

---

### Test Failure: `clients.test.js`

*   **Test Name:** `Client Integration Tests`
*   **Error Message:** `error: relation "jobs" does not exist`
*   **Hypothesis:** The test database migrations are failing. The `jobs` table is likely created in a later migration file than the `clients` table, but the tests are trying to access it. The migration runner in `__tests__/utils/testDatabase.js` is probably not executing the migrations in the correct order.

---

### Test Failure: `documents.test.js`

*   **Test Name:** `documents.test.js`
*   **Error Message:** `Cannot find module '/home/user/studio/bobby-vision/backend/routes/jobs' from 'server.js'`
*   **Hypothesis:** The `server.js` file is using absolute paths to require its routes. This is not portable and is causing the tests to fail in this environment. The paths should be relative.

---

### Test Failure: `jobs.test.js`

*   **Test Name:** `jobs.test.js`
*   **Error Message:** `Cannot find module '/home/user/studio/bobby-vision/backend/routes/jobs' from 'server.js'`
*   **Hypothesis:** Same as `documents.test.js`. The `server.js` file is using absolute paths.

---

### Test Failure: `nlpService.test.js`

*   **Test Name:** `nlpService.test.js`
*   **Error Message:** `Cannot find module '@google/genai' from '__tests__/services/nlpService.test.js'`
*   **Hypothesis:** The `@google/genai` module is not installed.

---

### Test Failure: `materials.test.js`

*   **Test Name:** `Materials Integration Tests`
*   **Error Message:** `error: relation "jobs" does not exist`
*   **Hypothesis:** Same as `clients.test.js`. The database migrations are not being run in the correct order.

---

### Test Failure: `serviceLibrary.test.js`

*   **Test Name:** `Service Library Integration Tests`
*   **Error Message:** `Cannot find module '/home/user/studio/bobby-vision/backend/routes/jobs' from 'server.js'`
*   **Hypothesis:** Same as `documents.test.js`. The `server.js` file is using absolute paths.

---

### Test Failure: `itemizationService.test.js`

*   **Test Name:** `itemizationService.test.js`
*   **Error Message:** `Cannot find module '@google/genai' from '__tests__/services/itemizationService.test.js'`
*   **Hypothesis:** The `@google/genai` module is not installed.

---

### Test Failure: `emailService.test.js`

*   **Test Name:** `Email Service Unit Tests`
*   **Error Message:** `expect(received).toBe(expected) // Object.is equality`
*   **Hypothesis:** The assertions in the tests are incorrect. The `draftEmail` function is not generating the email subject as the tests expect. I'll need to examine the `draftEmail` function and the test data to determine the correct subject.

---

### Test Failure: `externalApi.test.js`

*   **Test Name:** `externalApi.test.js`
*   **Error Message:** `Cannot find module '/home/user/studio/bobby-vision/backend/routes/jobs' from 'server.js'`
*   **Hypothesis:** Same as `documents.test.js`. The `server.js` file is using absolute paths.

---

### Test Failure: `auth.test.js`

*   **Test Name:** `auth.test.js`
*   **Error Message:** `Cannot find module '/home/user/studio/bobby-vision/backend/routes/jobs' from 'server.js'`
*   **Hypothesis:** Same as `documents.test.js`. The `server.js` file is using absolute paths. Additionally, the directive mentions that this file may be incomplete.
